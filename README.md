# Resfree
Customize your resolution with ease. Glow's Resolution Tool, a simple, lightweight tool to change Fortnite's predefined resolutions.

# What's this tool?
This resolution tool was specifically created to bypass the hassle of Fortnite's configuration files. Designed in C#, a tool that can easily swap resolution, change fullscreen modes, and change file editing modes with the click of a button.

# Top Pre-defined Strecthed Resolutions (Ranked least to most strecthed)
1. 1600x1080
2. 1440x1080
3. 1280x1024

# Why?
If you're in the Competitive Fortnite community, you'd know about the term "Stretched Res (Resolution)", a method that involves using a lower resolution and smaller aspect ratio to make the game look wider than usual, this alters FoV (Field of View), and also makes hitboxes bigger by the "wider" resolution.

# Will I get banned?
Absolutely not! Resolution can be defined by anyone, and is not a cheat. This tool simply edits your Fortnite config files (which you can do yourself by going to "%LocalAppData%\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\GameUserSettings.ini")

This tool uses all local environments to find your Fortnite config files, there is no memory editing involved and no chance of being banned. 

Please use tools third-party with discretion, as you may be installing a virus, or cheat, without even knowing.
